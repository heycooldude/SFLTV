Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculator
This Python code calculates the Simple Lifetime Value (LTV) of customers based on event data. It takes into account customer visits, image uploads, orders, and total spending to estimate the projected revenue that each customer will generate during their lifetime.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x installed
Required Python libraries: json, dateutil
You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install python-dateutil

Usage
Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.

Place the input data file named input.txt in the same directory as the code files.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the code files.

Run the following command to execute the code:

bash
Copy code
python filename.py
Replace filename.py with the actual name of the Python file containing the code.

The code will read the input data, calculate the Simple LTV for each customer, and generate an output file named output.txt in the same directory.

Open the output.txt file to view the top x customers with the highest Simple LTV, where x is the specified value.

Input
The input data should be provided in a file named input.txt in the following format:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "type": "CUSTOMER",
    "verb": "NEW",
    "key": "customer_id",
    "event_time": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ",
    "last_name": "Last Name",
    "adr_city": "City",
    "adr_state": "State"
  },
  {
    "type": "SITE_VISIT",
    "verb": "NEW",
    "key": "page_id",
    "event_time": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ",
    "customer_id": "customer_id",
    "tags": []
  },
  {
    "type": "IMAGE",
    "verb": "UPLOAD",
    "key": "image_id",
    "event_time": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ",
    "customer_id": "customer_id",
    "camera_make": "Camera Make",
    "camera_model": "Camera Model"
  },
  {
    "type": "ORDER",
    "verb": "NEW",
    "key": "order_id",
    "event_time": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ",
    "customer_id": "customer_id",
    "total_amount": "amount USD"
  },
  ...
]
Each event is represented as a JSON object with the following attributes:

type: The type of the event (CUSTOMER, SITE_VISIT, IMAGE, or ORDER).
verb: The verb associated with the event (NEW or UPDATE).
key: The unique identifier for the event (customer_id, page_id, image_id, or order_id).
event_time: The timestamp of the event in the format yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ.
Additional attributes specific to each event type.
The CUSTOMER event is used to create a new customer profile or update an existing one.

The SITE_VISIT event represents a customer visit to the site.

The IMAGE event represents a customer uploading an image.

The ORDER event represents a customer placing an order.

Output
The output is generated in a file named output.txt and contains the top x customers with the highest Simple LTV, where x is the specified value. Each line in the output file corresponds to a customer and includes their ID and calculated Simple LTV value:

yaml
Copy code
Customer ID: customer_id, LTV: calculated_value
The customers are listed in descending order of their Simple LTV values.
Make sure to review the output file to see the calculated Simple LTV values for the top x customers.
