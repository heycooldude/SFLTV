Calculate simple LTV using equation: 52(a) x t. t is 10 years here. a = customer expenditures per visit (USD) x number of site visits per week. A customer's expenditures is the sum of all expenditures of this customer, and the time of visit can be extracted from all his/her visit events. The timeframe is calculated by substracting the earliest time from the latest time, which are recorded from all event times.
